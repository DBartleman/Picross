# Picross
A lightweight mobile version of a classic puzzle game

Design Philosophy and Requirements:

* After loading the page once, the whole app can work offline from that point onward
* Tapping a square fills it in, holding down the tap marks it as empty
* Any grid size from 5x5 to 30x30 is allowed
* Text for numbers must be easily readable
* Game must accommodate landscape and portrait view modes
* Games are randomly generated
* The "two by two" trap that players run into is handled somehow
* Filled in pixels do not make up a picture when finished, this is a pure puzzle game
* Night Mode and OLED Mode (100% black night mode) supported
* Double-tap is disabled on mobile view, to prevent zooming in when you want to just tap tiles

Bonus:
* Fun/custom colors, possibly unlockable skins for the game grid
* Custom background uses photo from camera roll
* Score, time attack, bonus modes
* STATS (average time, total number of tiles filled in, total puzzles solved)
